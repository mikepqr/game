# Challenge

This repository contains a `playgame` function that, given a game object
that implements a couple of functions, plays a game.

## Understand the code

Read the code and understand how it works! Probably start with tic tac
toe (which has comments), then look at blackjack (which is a more
complicated game, and doesn't have comments!). In particular:

 - be sure you understand the role of iterators (lines 29-30 and lines
   106-107)
 - think about the "API", and in particular, imagine a how you would
   implement a simple game object that satisfies this API (examples of
   simple games include: who can toss the most heads, who can guess
   closest to the number the computer is thinking of, the prisoner's
   dilemma, or some other game).
 - think about the order in which you end up reading this code to make
   sense of it! It's probably not top-to-bottom. This is a useful skill!
 - (optionally, take a look at the history of this repository to see how
   it developed!)

## Fix blackjack

Do one of the TODOs listed to improve the blackjack game! They are in
approximate order of increasing difficulty. Send me your improvement as
a pull request.

## Extend the code

Implement the game you thought about above! Or change `playgame()` to
extend the API it supports by handling games with scores rather than
binary win/loss outcomes. Or something else!
